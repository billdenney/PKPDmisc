\title{cmax summary function}
\usage{
s_cmax(df, DV, na.rm = T, name = "CMAX", carry = FALSE,
  check_duplicates = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data frame. Can pass in grouped data frame to calculate by group}

\item{DV}{dependent variable column to calculate cmax on}

\item{na.rm}{boolean whether to remove NA values when returning max value
default = TRUE}

\item{name}{string name of output column. Default to `CMAX`}

\item{carry}{boolean whether to carry other columns. Defaults to FALSE}

\item{check_duplicates}{boolean whether to check for duplicates in each group 
after calculation}
}
\description{
cmax summary function
}
\details{
one trick for better performance is to turn off check duplicates
the function is already quite fast by using dplyr under the hood, but
if used in a simulation context where it may be used over and over, turning
this off will result in slightly better performance as it does not perform
the additional calculations to check for duplicate entries. 

The duplicates warning is due to the nature of cmax calculations often being used
in subsequent steps, either to see the time that cmax was reached, or for 
further calculations. Duplicate values per group (eg ID) can lead to odd behavior
in later calculations, thus duplicates are checked for and the user is warned by default.
